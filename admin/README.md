# people-action admin

[people-action admin](https://people-action.web.app) is an Angular app to manage locations on the [people-action map](../map/).

## Usage

Any user logged in with their Google account, can view locations.

> TODO: add other login methods

The `admin` role is needed to be able add and edit locations. For now, this is assigned very manually:

1. Copy the user's UID (the user must have logged in to [people-action admin](https://people-action.web.app) first) from the [Authentication](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/people-action/authentication/users) panel in the Firebase Console.
2. Create a document in the [users collection](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/people-action/database/firestore/data~2Fusers) in Firestore, with the `id` equal to the UID, and a `roles` map with the `admin` role:
    ```json
    {
      "roles": {
        "admin": true
      }
    }
    ```

## Development

[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) is used for this project. See 'Annexure: Angular CLI' below.

Run `npm install` after cloning.

## Deployment

> **There is no separate staging and production environments for now.**

A Firestore [database](../database/), and a Firestore hosting target, must be deployed, and details maintained in the relevant [environment](./src/environments/) file, and in [.firebaserc](./.firebaserc).

This Angular app is deployed to Firebase Hosting:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools # First time
firebase login
firebase target:apply hosting admin firestore-app-name # Once
npm run deploy
```
